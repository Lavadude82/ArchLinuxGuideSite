    1.0 - Setup for Installation
    <li>
      1.1 - Get a ISO/Disk Image<p>Let's get an ISO first. You can do this by clicking the arch icon with a down arrow
        in the home page. It takes
        you to the <a href="https://archlinux.org">Arch linux</a> website download page. Scroll down and select a mirror
        based on your location for a faster download. Choose any URL below your mirror selection and click it. Then
        click a file with the <bold>archlinux-YYYY.DD.MM-x86_64.iso</bold> format (doesn't have to be the same day as
        today).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      1.2 - Flash ISO/Disk Image using Etcher or Ventoy<p> Let's get a flashing tool, <a
          href="https://etcher.balena.io">Etcher</a> is really simple to use. <a href="https://ventoy.net">Ventoy</a>
        allows you to have multiple ISO/Disk Images on your usb at once. You can choose one, they will both be explained
        here and are linked in the home page.
        <br><br>
        <bold-big>Etcher</bold-big><br>
        Etcher can be downloaded from <a href="https://etcher.balena.io">Etcher's site</a>. Once opened, click select
        image and browse for the ISO/Disk Image you've downloaded. Now plug in your USB Flash Drive and
        click select drive, it should appear on the list. If so, select your USB (<red>BE CARFUL TO SELECT THE CORRECT
          DRIVE AS THE DRIVE SELECTED WILL BE ERASED</red>). Then click flash and wait, etcher will tell you when it is
        done. At this point you may remove your Flash Drive and follow to the next step (<bold>2.1</bold>).
        <br><br>
        <bold-big>Ventoy</bold-big><br>
        Ventoy can be downloaded from <a href="https://ventoy.net">Ventoy's site</a>. Once opened, plug in your USB
        Flash Drive and click the dropdown below <bold>Device</bold>. Select your USB Flash Drive from the list (<red>BE
          CARFUL TO
          SELECT THE CORRECT DRIVE AS THE DRIVE SELECTED WILL BE ERASED</red>). Now click install, and ventoy will let
        you know when it's done. After it is done, open your file explorer and look for a partition (or a device that
        shows up as a USB Drive) called <bold>Ventoy</bold>. Once located, copy the ISO/Disk Image to the partition.
        Once done unplug your USB, and follow to the
        next step (<bold>2.1</bold>).

    2.0 - Boot & Partitioning
    <li>
      2.1 - Boot from ISO/Disk Image<p>
        <yellow>Make sure you know how to access the boot menu of your computer!</yellow>
        <red>YOU NEED TO DISABLE SECURE BOOT!</red> Fully shutdown your computer
        and plug your USB Flash Drive into your computer. Access your boot menu by tapping the key your manufacturer
        set. Then select your USB Flash Drive and click Enter or Boot. <bold>For ventoy click enter two more times.
        </bold> You are now booting into the Arch Linux Live ISO/Disk Image. Once you see something similar to <bold>
          [root@archiso root]#</bold>, you may proceed to the next step (<bold>2.2</bold>).
      </p>

      2.2 - Partitioning Drive<p>
        Let's start making the base of your system. Run <bold>fdisk /dev/sda</bold><br>
        <yellow>This is NOT a dual-boot tutorial!</yellow> Now type <bold>g</bold> and hit enter (If any popup appears,
        click y, <red>THIS WILL REMOVE YOUR DEVICE'S SIGNATURES!</red>). We have an empty GPT partition table now. Let's
        add partitions. Type <bold>n</bold> and click enter three times, then type <bold>+500M</bold> and click enter.
        Type <bold>t</bold> and click enter, then <bold>1</bold> and click enter. This will be our EFI partition. Let's
        make
        our main partition. Type <bold>n</bold> and click enter four times. Now type <bold>w</bold> and click enter.
        We've made our partitions, let's move to formatting and pacstrap (<bold>3.0</bold>).
      </p>
    </li>
    <split></split>
    3.0 - Formatting and Pacstrapping
    <li>
      3.1 - Formatting partitions
      <p>Let's begin by formatting our boot partition. Our boot partiton is <bold>/dev/<italic>drive</italic>1</bold>
        <br><br>Replace <bold>drive</bold> with your drive <br>Examples: <br>
        <bold>sda</bold><br>
        <bold>mmcblk0</bold> (needs a <bold>p</bold> for partition between device and number)<br>
        <bold>nvme0n1</bold> <br><br>Run <bold>mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/<italic>
            drive</italic>1</bold>, if any prompts, type y and click enter. Let's format our main partition, run <bold>
          mkfs.ext4 /dev/<italic>drive</italic>2</bold>, if any prompts, type y and click enter. After that, we can
        move to our next step (<bold>3.2</bold>).
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      3.2 - Mounting and Pacstrapping
      <p>Run <bold>mount /dev/<italic>drive</italic>2 /mnt</bold> and <bold>mount --mkdir /dev/<italic>drive</italic>1
          /mnt/boot</bold>. <br> Let's connect to wifi, <yellow>if you are using ethernet, skip this step</yellow> -
        <br><br>
        Run <bold>iwctl</bold> and type <bold>station wlan0 connect <italic>WifiName</italic>
        </bold> (replace <bold>WifiName</bold> with your WifiName/SSID) then it will prompt you for a password if
        required. After you entered your password type exit and hit enter. To test your wifi type <bold>ping google.com
        </bold>, if it says <bold>ping: google.com: Temporary failure in name resolution</bold>, retry this from the Run iwctl step.
        <br>
        <br>Let's get a base system with pacstrap, run <bold>pacstrap -K /mnt base linux-lts linux-firmware grub
          efibootmgr</bold>
      </p>
    </li>
